# -MY-SPY-ANDROID
My Spy is a surveillance/monitoring app which works on both a personal computer and a phone.
• Our computer application can monitor and block internet sites or social networks, and can also block and find out what
applications the user has been using, find out what the user has written and set the maximum usage time on the
computer.
• The mobile app monitors SMS messages, phone calls, user’s movements, and the apps he has used. Another part of the
app is a communications app which works on both the computer and the mobile phone, and is used for communication,
for example, between a child and his parent.
